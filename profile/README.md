# Welcome to the Topsakal Lab GitHub README üëã

This README is the landing page for the [Topsakal-Lab GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Topsakal-Lab). If you are a current student and need access to the repositories, please reach out to one of the grad students for access. 


## üì° About Us
-  The Topsakal Lab GitHub Org is the primary code organization method for a research group run by [Dr. Erdem Topsakal](https://egr.vcu.edu/directory/erdem.topsakal/) in the College of Engineering at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.
-  We have active research in a number of topics centered on medical & RF applications, including:
      - Wireless communications, design, simulation, and implementation.
      - Wearable and textile-based RF designs.
      - RF shielding and filtering.
      - Medical device security.
      - AI and LLM integration and applications.
